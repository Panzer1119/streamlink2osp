==============

Streamlink2osp is a tool that enables users to stream video content from various sources
using [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) directly to
an [Open Streaming Platform](https://openstreamingplatform.com/) (OSP) instance.
It is distributed as a Docker image and can be easily run on any machine that has Docker installed.

OSP is a great tool for streaming video content to the web, but it does not support
streaming from sources other than RTMP. This is where streamlink2osp comes in.
It allows users to stream video content from various sources to OSP using Streamlink.

Have you ever wanted to pause or rewind a Twitch livestream while it's playing, only to find out that Twitch does not
offer this functionality? Or have you come across a streamer who doesn't provide VoDs or has them disabled? This can be
frustrating, especially if you miss something important or want to review a section of the stream later.

One solution to this problem is to re-stream the Twitch livestream to an Open Streaming Platform (OSP) instance. By
doing so, you can pause, rewind, or even re-watch the livestream at your own pace. Additionally, re-streaming to OSP
acts as a recorder, allowing you to capture the livestream in its entirety, even if the streamer doesn't offer VoDs.

This is where `streamlink2osp` comes in. By using this tool, you can easily download the Twitch livestream using
Streamlink, and then upload it to your OSP instance. With configurable environment variables, you can customize the
quality, disable ads or reruns, and even retry failed streams. So why wait? Start re-streaming your favorite Twitch
livestreams to OSP today!

Even though Twitch added the ability to pause and rewind livestreams in 2021, it was a limited test phase of 1
month[^1].
And it seems like a streamer have had to manually enable this feature[^2], meaning they can leave it disabled as well.
